I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. Using the data provided [students_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) and [schools_complete.csv](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv), I was responsible to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Data anlyasis completed using Python, Jupyter and Pandas.

My final output report includes each of the following: [PyCitySchools_Outcome](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starterHW.ipynb)

### Scores by School Size
* Grouping schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

### Observations
* Top performing school was Charter school, named Wilson High with total # of 2283 students with avg math score of 83.99, avg reading score of 90.93.
* Schools with a size of 2000 or less students have higher average scores and also higher percentage of students passing in both subjects.
* Players are predominantly male and make up 84.03% of the total player base.
* With an average item purchase price of $4.56, players who choose not to disclose their gender tend to spend more than Males and Females.
